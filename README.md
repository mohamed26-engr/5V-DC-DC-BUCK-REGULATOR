# 5V-DC-DC-BUCK-REGULATOR
Designed a 5V DC-DC buck converter PCB using a switching regulator IC in KiCad. The project includes schematic design, component selection, footprint assignment, and PCB layout. Proper decoupling, power routing, and grounding were implemented to ensure stable and efficient output for embedded systems.
